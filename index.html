            <p>In recent years, significant advancements have been made in offline reinforcement learning, with a growing number of novel algorithms of varying degrees of complexity. Despite this progress, the significance of specific design choices and the application of common deep learning techniques remains unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the D4RL benchmark through a simple set of modifications to the minimalist offline RL approach and careful hyperparameter search. Furthermore, our ablations emphasize the importance of minor design choices and hyperparameter tuning while highlighting the untapped potential of using deep learning techniques in offline reinforcement learning.</p>

            <p>Despite the success of Random Network Distillation (RND) in various domains, it was shown as not discriminative enough to be used as an uncertainty estimator for penalizing out-of-distribution actions in offline reinforcement learning. In this paper, we revisit these results and show that, with a naive choice of conditioning for the RND prior, it becomes infeasible for the actor to effectively minimize the anti-exploration bonus and discriminativity is not an issue. We show that this limitation can be avoided with conditioning based on Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM), resulting in a simple and efficient ensemble-free algorithm based on Soft Actor-Critic. We evaluate it on the D4RL benchmark, showing that it is capable of achieving performance comparable to ensemble-based methods and outperforming ensemble-free approaches by a wide margin.</p>

It emphasizes a simple developing experience with a straightforward codebase and a modern analysis tracking tool. In CORL, we isolate methods implementation into distinct single files, making performance-relevant details easier to recognise. Additionally, an experiment tracking feature is available to help log metrics, hyperparameters, dependencies, and more to the cloud. Finally, we have ensured the reliability of the implementations by benchmarking a commonly employed D4RL benchmark.</p>

            <p>Training large neural networks is known to be time-consuming, with the learning duration taking days or even weeks. To address this problem, large-batch optimization was introduced. This approach demonstrated that scaling mini-batch sizes with appropriate learning rate adjustments can speed up the training process by orders of magnitude. While long training time was not typically a major issue for model-free deep offline RL algorithms, recently introduced Q-ensemble methods achieving state-of-the-art performance made this issue more relevant, notably extending the training duration. In this work, we demonstrate how this class of methods can benefit from large-batch optimization, which is commonly overlooked by the deep offline RL community. We show that scaling the mini-batch size and naively adjusting the learning rate allows for (1) a reduced size of the Q-ensemble, (2) stronger penalization of out-of-distribution actions, and (3) improved convergence time, effectively shortening training duration by 2.5x times on average.</p>

            <p>Offline reinforcement learning aims to train a policy on a pre-recorded and fixed dataset without any additional environment interactions. There are two major challenges in this setting: (1) extrapolation error caused by approximating the value of state-action pairs not well-covered by the training data and (2) distributional shift between behavior and inference policies. One way to tackle these problems is to induce conservatism - i.e., keeping the learned policies closer to the behavioral ones. To achieve this, we build upon recent works on learning policies in latent action spaces and use a special form of Normalizing Flows for constructing a generative model, which we use as a conservative action encoder. This Normalizing Flows action encoder is pre-trained in a supervised manner on the offline dataset, and then an additional policy model - controller in the latent space - is trained via reinforcement learning.

                This approach avoids querying actions outside of the training dataset and therefore does not require additional regularization for out-of-dataset actions. We evaluate our method on various locomotion and navigation tasks, demonstrating that our approach outperforms recently proposed algorithms with generative action models on a large portion of datasets.</p>

            <p>In this preliminary study, we introduce a simple way to leverage pre-trained language models in deep offline RL settings that are not naturally suited for textual
                representation. We propose using a state transformation into a human-readable
                text and a minimal fine-tuning of the pre-trained language model when training
                with deep offline RL algorithms. This approach shows consistent performance
                gains on the NeoRL MuJoCo datasets. Our experiments suggest that LM finetuning is crucial for good performance on robotics tasks. However, we also show
                that it is not necessary when working with finance environments in order to retain
                significant improvement in the final performance.</p>

                <p>Today, various neural network models are trained using distributed learning in order to reduce the time spent. Slow network
                    communication between devices can significantly reduce distribution efficiency. Recent studies propose one-bit versions
                    of the Adam and LAMB algorithms, which can significantly reduce the amount of transmitted information, as a result of
                    which the scalability of training is improved. However, it turned out that these algorithms diverge on some neural network
                    architectures. The goal of this work is an empirical study of these algorithms, to find the solution of the discovered divergence
                    problem and the proposal of new aspects of testing gradient descent algorithms.</p>
